In the above code we assume that a declared variable initialises to a value of `0` - this is correct within Arduino, but is it true for all microcontrollers?

This is a normal way to understand how some code is working.  Try printing the value of `millis()` at each loop(), the value of `activity_ts`, the value of `elapsed_time`, and the value of `activity_ms` (this last one should stay fixed).  It can also help to draw a timeline on paper, and work out the maths by hand (it is simple).  A member of teaching staff will be happy to discuss it with you."

In the above template, we only check if `elapsed_time` is greater than `>` the interval we want `activity_ms`.  Therefore, it is possible that the elapsed time could be **a lot bigger** than our desired interval, because some other piece of code took a very long time to run.  However, it is still a very good idea to have some schedule of when your robot should perform certain operations, because this will help to make your robot behaviours more predictable, understandable and easier to debug.  If you don't try any control of the flow of your program, the timing of your program will vary greatly depending on the behaviour of the sensors, actuators, algorithms, etc."
