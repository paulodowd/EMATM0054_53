        "From previous experience on this unit, there is occasionally an issue where the standard `switch case` selection mechanism does not operate properly.  You may find that even though your conditional statement is valid, the `switch case` fails to enter the valid case and execute code.  It is not known why this happens - presumably there is a bug in the compiler.\n",
